# React Chatbox

This is a mock-up single page app that I've started on another repo
as an html, css and vanilla javascript project for practice.

On june/2022, I've joined (@lpohren)[https://github.com/lpohren] for a pizza
and he showed me how we could do that on React.

The first commit of this repo is where we left it at.

### Upcoming feats:

- Username and color selection window;
- Simple page routing;
- Mock-up Data fetching;
